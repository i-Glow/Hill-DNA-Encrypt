# Hill-DNA-Encrypt

## Description
This repository contains an algorithm that transforms text into DNA sequences and applies HILL encryption/description for enhanced security.

## How it works
### 1. Text to DNA Conversion:
The input text is processed to create a corresponding DNA sequence.
A mapping system is used to convert each character of the text into a specific DNA base pair representation.

### 2. HILL Encryption:
After the text has been transformed into DNA sequences, the HILL encryption algorithm is applied.
HILL encryption is a symmetric-key algorithm that operates on matrices. The DNA sequences are treated as matrices, and encryption is performed using a key matrix.
The encrypted DNA sequences can be stored or transmitted securely.

## Usage
To use this algorithm in your project:
### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-Glow/Hill-DNA-Encrypt.git
```

### 2. Run using node:
```bash
node hill-dna.js
```
